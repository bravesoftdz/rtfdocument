# rtfdocument

This is Delphi translation of the C# library https://github.com/elistia/DotNetRtfWriter
It uses a linked list which I took from https://delphihaven.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/generic-linked-lists-redux/

This is a very tiny part of Picto-Selector, which is using it to export visual schedules to RTF files.
